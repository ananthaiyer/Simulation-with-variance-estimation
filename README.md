# Simulation-with-variance-estimation
This project implements and evaluates four variance calculation algorithms, comparing their performance against R's var function as the gold standard. Key tasks include:

    Implementing the algorithms as functions and creating a wrapper function.
    Comparing computational performance through tables and graphs.
    Investigating scale invariance and performance using condition numbers.
    Analyzing condition numbers for two simulated datasets and one non-compliant dataset.
